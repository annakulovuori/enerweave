# Enerweave

### About

As homes become increasingly equipped with solar panels, EV chargers, and smart devices, finding the right energy management system can feel overwhelming. That’s where EnerWeave steps in.

Designed to make energy management simple and accessible, EnerWeave analyzes the devices in your home and identifies the best solution to bring them all together seamlessly. Whether it’s syncing solar panels with a battery system or integrating EV chargers and smart appliances, it finds the perfect match tailored to your setup.

### Roles
EnerWeave has been developed in collaboration with Spine Energy, Business Information Systems students from Tampere University of Applied Sciences, and Business students from Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences.

I've been involved mainly in developing backend, but also using AWS and designing frontend.
